My name is Henrique Quirino and I live in *Uberlandia-MG* (Brazil). Actually I'm in my sixth year of studying Information Systems and I'm looking for a job as a ***Fullstack developer*** or ***cybersecurity analyst***.

Passionate about *web development* and *cybersecurity* with some knowledge in the areas of network infrastructure and database management, looking to improve my skills in thes areas day by day.

Currently I'm an intern at the *Processamento de Dados de Uberlandia - PRODAUB* company, providing support for the systems used by the *Uberlandia* City Hall, solving problems reported by users related to systems, network and databases.

I'm always willing to learn and discover new areas of technology...
